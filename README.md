# It Does Not Work - Reporting Errors

When reporting bugs or technical issues, whether through a ticketing system, email, or any other channel, it's important to provide detailed, clear information. A report that simply says "It does not work" is too vague and prevents efficient problem resolution. Be specific about what you're experiencing, including steps to reproduce the error, any relevant error messages, and the context in which the problem occurs. Detailed reports lead to faster and more effective troubleshooting.

**Ineffective Error Report:**

Subject: It does not work\
Content: The feature isn't functioning.

This type of report lacks crucial details, forcing the support or technical team to follow up for more information, delaying the troubleshooting process.

**Effective Error Report:**

Subject: Application Crash on Opening Annual Sales Report\
Content: Encountering an application crash when trying to access the annual sales report. An error message displays: “File not found.” Steps to replicate: 1. Launch application, 2. Go to Reports section, 3. Select ‘Annual Sales’. Issue noticed on version 2.1, Windows 10 system.

In your error reports, include:

1. **Clear, Descriptive Subject or Title**: Give a precise, informative headline.
2. **Detailed Description**: Explain what isn't working. Describe in detail what you expected to happen versus what actually happened.
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Clearly list the actions that lead up to the issue. This is essential to quickly reproduce and diagnose the issue.
4. **Environmental Context**: Include any relevant information about the environment where the issue occurs (e.g., software version, operating system, browser type).
5. **Error Messages and Logs**: If there are any error messages or log entries, include them verbatim. They can provide essential clues to the underlying cause.
6. **Screenshots or Visuals**: When possible, attach screenshots or screen recordings. Visual context can be very helpful in understanding the exact nature of the problem.

The goal of effective error reporting is to enable whoever is resolving your issue to understand and diagnose the problem without needing to request additional information. Detailed, comprehensive initial reports can save significant time and effort, resulting in faster resolutions. Moreover, this approach shows respect for your colleagues' time and contributes to a more efficient, collaborative working environment.

Remember, the quality of support or assistance you receive often depends on the quality of the information you provide. Clear, detailed, and structured error reporting is essential for effective problem-solving in any technical context.
